## Abstract
In this paper, a new publicly available web-Scraped Iranian Vehicle Dataset (SIVD) for simultaneous real-time vehicle tracking and recognition is proposed. The datasets provided for Iranian cars in the literature have two fundamental problems. First, the lack of images from different angles, and second, the small number of classes compared to the dispersion of car models in the real world. Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, Iranian vehicle images from car sales websites are collected, and the SIVD dataset is proposed which contains 29 classes and 36,705 images. This paper aims at developing a classification network for Iranian vehicle recognition and implement a real-time tracking system using the YOLOv5 network to perform real-time vehicle model recognition and tracking tasks simultaneously. The ResNet50 achieved an accuracy of 99.29%, the highest among the investigated classification networks.
